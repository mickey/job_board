      <p>Company</p>

<p>Beezwax Datatools, Inc. is a boutique development agency based in Oakland, CA, with developers working around the greater San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. For more than 14 years we have designed custom web, database and desktop applications for organizations of all sizes, working in dialog with our clients to create powerful, elegant solutions using various technologies.</p>

<p>Beezwax is an extremely pro-developer firm, contributing tools and education to the wider developer community, while supporting all members of our team in leading fulfilling, creative lives.</p>

<p>Position</p>

<p>We’re focused on creating the next generation of highly interactive, usable information applications, expert systems that streamline our clients’ workflow and make business fun again. We use AJAX, Ruby on Rails, Flash and PHP working with both SQL and FileMaker databases on the back end.</p>

<p>We’re looking for a new developer to help us turn around a wide variety of open projects. You should be actively engaged and passionate about the technologies you’re using, quick to learn, willing to teach and collaborate. Recent CS/CE grads especially encouraged to apply.</p>

We are open to working with freelancers on a per-project basis.</p>
